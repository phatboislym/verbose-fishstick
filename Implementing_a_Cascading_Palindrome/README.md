# Implementing a Cascading Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, sentence, verse or number that reads the same backwards
  or forward. A typical palindrome class will accept a parameter such as a word
  or number and return true or false if the word is a palindrome. However, your
  task is to implement a cascading palindrome - a cascading palindrome in the
  context of this task means the following:

1. The class takes a parameter with several components. The parameter could be
  a word, a sentence, multiple numbers, etc. The parameter contains various
  items separated by space.
2. The class determines the part of the parameter that is a palindrome and
  returns only the palindrome part of the parameter.
For clarity, consider these examples:

- 1230321  returns 1230321
- 1230321 09234 0124210 returns 1230321 0124210
- abcd5dcba 1230321 09234 0124210 returns abcd5dcba 1230321 0124210

You can assume that the example structure above will always be the case for
  this task. For example, this sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal – Panama"
  is a palindrome; however, you don't need to consider such a case in your
  implementation.

While implementing a palindrome or even a cascading palindrome could be
  considered easy, the difficulty is efficiency. Your code needs to consider
  the following:

1. Efficiency: Use as little memory as possible
2. Speed: Ensure the fastest result regardless of how many components the
  parameter has
3. Validation: validation data given by users and return appropriate responses
  if invalid data is given
4. Error handling: return appropriate error messages when something goes wrong

To help you with the four points above, consider watching and studying the
  following:

2. [Big O Notations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6mKVRU1evU)
3. [Big Oh Notation (and Omega and Theta)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6mKVRU1evU)

While these videos will help you with the concepts mentioned, you can explore
  other sources for better understanding.

In addition to the information already provided in this task, please note the
  following:

- You are expected to use OOP so that your code is reusable
- Leave proper commenting
- Have at least ten examples defined in your code on how your class was used to
  determine and fetch out the palindrome in a given parameter.
- Ensure you follow the [feedback](https://github.com/xyluz/feedback) already provided

## Hint

You'll see that for each word above, that is a palindrome. The letter in the
  centre forms the base of your check. If the letters on the right and to the
  left of the centre letter are not the same, then such a word is not a
  palindrome, and you'll not need to do any further checks.
